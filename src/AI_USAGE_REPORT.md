While building the AI-powered analytics dashboard, I used AI tools like ChatGPT to assist me throughout the development process — mainly for brainstorming ideas, fixing issues faster, and getting help with React + Tailwind integration.

Initially, I had a general idea of what the dashboard should look like, but AI helped me figure out how to structure it better with reusable components like LineChart, BarChart, PieChart, and AISummary. I already knew some basics, but whenever I got stuck with features like dark mode, real-time updates, or exporting CSV, AI helped me understand what to do next — almost like having a tutor sitting next to me.

I didn't rely entirely on AI to generate the whole project. I built the components myself and used ChatGPT mainly to speed things up when I wasn’t sure how to implement a particular logic (e.g., updating chart data every 5 seconds or integrating MUI with Tailwind). It also helped me debug a few small issues in useEffect, and gave me clear steps for deploying to Vercel.

Overall, using AI saved me time and helped me stay focused instead of switching tabs to read long documentation or StackOverflow threads. I still had to write, modify, and understand the code myself, but having AI helped guide and correct me along the way.
